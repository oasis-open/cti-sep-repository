# SEP Name
Microsoft Windows Event Log

## SEP Identifier
`x-oasis-cti-tc-windows-event-log`

## SEP Version
1

## SEP Description
This SEP is the Microsoft Windows event log descriptor.
Windows Event Logging framework include many features which give security professionals capability to correlate and
aggregate logs in a Windows environment.

## SEP Use Cases
* Observe Windows operating system events
* Correlate Windows events from machines
* Analyse time series of Windows events
* Track Windows Logon and Authentication technologies in a Microsoft Windows environment.

## SEP Extension Context
* Use  [`process`](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas/blob/master/schemas/observables/process.json)
* Can be used with [`windows-registry-key`](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas/blob/master/schemas/observables/windows-registry-key.json)

## SEP Definition
The Windows Event Log SCO represents Microsoft Windows Event Log of a Microsoft Windows operating system, corresponding to
the [Microsoft Event Schema Definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/wes/eventschema-schema) and [EVTX and Windows Event Logging - SANS.org](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/logging/paper/32949) recommended fields.   
The Windows event log object represents the Windows Log content generated by the Microsoft Windows operating system. It does not include any application logs that doesn't use the Windows Event Log Service.


## Properties
| Property Name              | Type      | Description                            |
| -------------              | ----      | -----------                            |
| **sep_version** (required) | `integer` | The software that logged the event, which can be either a program name, such as "SQL Server", or a component of the system or of a large program, such as a driver name. For example, "Elnkii" indicates an EtherLink II driver. |
| **source** (required) | `string` | [The version of the SEP](#sep-version) |
| **event_id** (required) | `integer` | A number identifying the particular event type. The first line of the description usually contains the name of the event type. For example, 6005 is the ID of the event that occurs when the Event Log service is started. The first line of the description of such an event is "The Event log service was started." The Event ID and the Source can be used by product support representatives to troubleshoot system problems. |
| **level** (required) | `string` | A classification of the event severity. The following event severity levels can occur in the system and application logs:<ul><li>**Information.** Indicates that a change in an application or component has occurred, such as an operation has successfully completed, a resource has been created, or a service started.</li><li>**Warning.** Indicates that an issue has occurred that can impact service or result in a more serious problem if action is not taken.</li><li>**Error.** Indicates that a problem has occurred, which might impact functionality that is external to the application or component that triggered the event.</li><li>**Critical.** Indicates that a failure has occurred from which the application or component that triggered the event cannot automatically recover.</ul>The following event severity levels can occur in the security log:<ul><li>**Success Audit.** Indicates that the exercise of a user right has succeeded.</li><li>**Failure Audit.** Indicates that the exercise of a user right has failed.</li></ul>  In the Event Viewer normal list view, these are represented by a symbol.  |
| **sid** (optional) | `pattern` of type `string` | [Microsoft Security Identifier `SID`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/secauthz/security-identifiers) A data structure of variable length that identifies user, group, and computer accounts. Every account on a network is issued a unique SID when the account is first created. Internal processes in Windows refer to an account's SID rather than the account's user or group name.|
| **user** (optional) | `string` | The name of the user on whose behalf the event occurred. This name is the client ID if the event was actually caused by a server process or the primary ID if impersonation is not taking place. |
| **operational_code** (optional) | `integer` | Contains a numeric value that identifies the activity or a point within an activity that the application was performing when it raised the event. |
| **log** (optional) | `string` | The name of the log where the event was recorded. |
| **task_category** (optional) | `string` | Used to represent a subcomponent or activity of the event publisher. |
| **keywords** (optional) | `string` | A set of categories or tags that can be used to filter or search for events. |
| **computer** (optional) | `string` | The name of the computer on which the event occurred. |
| **date_time** (optional) | `timestamp` | The date and time that the event was logged. |
| **pid** (optional) | `pid` type of [`process`](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas/blob/master/schemas/observables/process.json) | The identification number for the process that generated the event. |
| **thread_id** (optional) | `integer` | The identification number for the thread that generated the event. |
| **processor_id** (optional) | `integer` | The identification number for the processor that processed the event. |
| **session_id** (optional) | `integer` | The identification number of the terminal server session in whcih the event occured. |
| **kernel_time** (optional) | `duration` type of [`timestamp`](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas/blob/master/schemas/common/timestamp.json)| The elapsed execution time for kernel-mode instructions, in CPU time units. |
| **user_time** (optional) | `duration` type of [`timestamp`](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas/blob/master/schemas/common/timestamp.json) | The elapsed execution time for user-mode instructions, in CPU time units. |
| **processor_time** (optional) | `duration` type of [`timestamp`](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas/blob/master/schemas/common/timestamp.json) | The elapsed execution time for user-mode instructions, in CPU ticks. |
| **correlation_id** (optional) | `integer` | Identifies the activity in the process for which the event is involved. This identifier is used to specify simple relationships between events. |
| **relative_correlation_id** (optional) | `integer` | Identifies a related activity in a process for which the event is involved. |
