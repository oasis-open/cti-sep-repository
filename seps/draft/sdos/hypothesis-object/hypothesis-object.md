# SEP Name
Hypothesis Object

## SEP Identifier
x-oasis-cti-tc-hypothesis

## SEP Version
1

## SEP Description
A Hypothesis Object would be a way to structure the process of hypothesis-testing. Currently, ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)
is conducted by analysts, producers, and consumers of intelligence to score and weigh evidence about a given threat. There is no way to structure
these findings as STIX entities; nor is there a way to show which hypothesis scored the strongest out of the set of hyptheses that were tested. 

## SEP Use Cases
* Structuring the proecss of ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)
* Have an entity that could represent analyst tradecraft
* Increase collaboration between providers/consumers of CTI who have varying hypotheses around a threat/relationship
* Have a machine readable way to identify patterns in hypotheses over time

## SEP Extension Context
* TBD
